# Zero OAuth Login Pass

`Loginpass` contains lots of connections to common services, every connection has a `Profile` that is represented for user info. It supports `OAuth 1`, `OAuth 2` and `OpenID Connect`.

The `Profile` is standardized with [OpenID Connect UserInfo claims](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims)
